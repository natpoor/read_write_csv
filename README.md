# read_write_csv
Read and write CSV files, in function format, gets the header in the code (no need to pass it).

I think I have the basic read and write up here, but I usually use them in a function call, so I added
a little code for that and the indents, and I also added code so it gets the header
from the dict keys of the first line. Still uses a lists of dicts for both ends.
